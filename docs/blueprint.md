## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light purple (#A096E6), reflecting creativity and innovation within a coding environment. This is in line with the user request for purple accents, and moves toward the center of the wheel in order to stand out from the beige backgrounds below.
- Background color: Very light yellow, almost white, like beige (#FAF9F6) creates a soft, neutral backdrop, and is based on a user request. Choosing light yellow (beige) is unconventional and subtly unique.
- Accent color: Soft teal (#70A1AF), positioned near purple on the color wheel to complement the primary color and adds a cool, modern touch, and stands apart due to changes in brightness and saturation
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a tech-oriented and slightly pixelated look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets.
- Subtle icons that integrate with a binary, grid-based background.
- Incorporate subtle binary, grids, and line designs in the background to reinforce the coding theme.
